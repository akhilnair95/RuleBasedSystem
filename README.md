Rule Based System:
---------------------
A java program that implements a rule based expert system

This rule based system tests the truth value of a statement based on the assertions given in Assertions.txt and the set of rules(defined in xml) given in the file rules.xml

This is a project work for a course that I took in AI from MIT open courseware

Ref:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leXa7EKUPFk&index=3&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi

I have used backward chaining methodology to imlement this system.

The current assertions.txt and rules.xml are set to the values for an exercise who details can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusTmgQyZ44&index=23&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi


How to use:
-------------------------

I have given the code that can be exported to Eclipse. So for people using eclipse, download the RuleBasedSystem folder and import to eclipse and you are ready to go.
