Rule Based System:
---------------------
A java program that implements a rule based expert system

This rule based system tests the truth value of a statement based on the assertions given in Assertions.txt and the set of rules(defined in xml) given in the file rules.xml

This is a project work for a course that I took in AI from MIT open courseware

I have used backward chaining methodology to imlement this system.

The current assertions.txt and rules.xml are set to the values for an exercise who details can be seen at goo.gl/HkzZNT


How to use:
-------------------------

I have given the code that can be exported to Eclipse. So for people using eclipse, download the RuleBasedSystem folder and import to eclipse and you are ready to go.

For others

1.Download the code 

2.Unzip the folder 

3.Go to /RuleBasedSystem/Readytorun/

4.Change the contents of Assertions.txt and rules.xml
(For syntax of rules.xml, see xmldoc.txt file)

5.open your terminal and type javac Rule_based_system.java and then type java Rule_based_system

6.Type the statement you want to test and you are ready to go.


Note : The documentation for rules.xml is given in the file ruledoc.txt
